This repository showcases an uncommon scenario involving the handling of ArithmeticException in Java.  The main focus is on illustrating a situation where the exception is not immediately obvious, particularly in scenarios where division by zero might occur due to unexpected input values or edge cases within more complex applications. Solutions will focus on robust error handling, including input validation.
